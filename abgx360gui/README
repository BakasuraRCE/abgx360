If you encounter this error:
                wxWidgets must be installed on your system.

                Please check that wx-config is in path, the directory
                where wxWidgets libraries are installed (returned by
                'wx-config --libs' or 'wx-config --static --libs' command)
                is in LD_LIBRARY_PATH or equivalent variable and
                wxWidgets version is 2.7.1 or above.

First check that wx-config exists in your path (normally /usr/local/bin); it
might be named something else like wxgtk2-2.8-config, and you will need to create
a symbolic link named wx-config in order for the configure script to find it.

Example: sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/wxgtk2-2.8-config /usr/local/bin/wx-config
