Sorry for the downtime over the past couple of weeks, but the site has now been moved to a new server. Our many thanks to our friends at [Team-Xecuter](http://team-xecuter.com) for graciously providing the bandwidth from now on!

However, our original first domain abgx360.net has been completely different site for a few years now. As such to get the abgx360 app working again you will need to download this [abgx360.ini](https://bakasurarce.github.io/abgx360/abgx360.ini.zip) file and extract it from the zip archive to the folder directly above your StealthFiles folder. To find out where your StealthFiles folder is, open abgx360 GUI v1.0.6 and press Ctrl+F (and click yes to have it opened for you). Then go one folder up to where you see the abgx360.dat file and put that abgx360.ini file you extracted in there right next to it.

From now on our domain and site is located at https://abgx360.xecuter.com with an special reverse proxy now working at http://abgx360.cc for the outdated GUI itself, since it can not corrently handle today's era of always-secure connections.

Our many thanks for all your valuable user feedback on the TX Forums recently and your stay calm patience in getting us back up and running again with the first changes in over 4 years.
