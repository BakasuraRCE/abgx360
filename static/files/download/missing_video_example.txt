Example abgx360 output:

	Failed to find or open 'Video_1914211B.iso' (No such file or directory)
	This is a very large video partition that isn't hosted on the database, so
	you'll have to find it elsewhere and put it in your StealthFiles folder --
	Check the Download page on abgx360.net
	AutoFix Failed


In this example you would need to download 'Video_1914211B.rar' and extract
'Video_1914211B.iso' to your StealthFiles folder. Alternatively, you could get
the entire Video ISO archive and extract them all to your StealthFiles folder.

To find out where your StealthFiles folder is, open abgx360 GUI v1.0.2 or later
and press Ctrl+F (and click yes to have it opened for you).

Note to Windows users: If you have limited space in your Windows partition, you
can re-install abgx360 on a different partition and put the Video ISOs in that
abgx360\StealthFiles folder instead of the main one that abgx360 GUI tells you
about. Note that this only works for Video ISOs and not other types of Stealth
Files.
